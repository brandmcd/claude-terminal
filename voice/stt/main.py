# #region live dictation (streaming transcription for the composer mic)
# The one-shot /transcribe above is right for hands-free voice mode: one utterance in, one text out.
# Dictation is different — you want to watch words appear while you talk, and you may talk for a
# minute. So the browser sends raw PCM16 mono 16k in ~500ms chunks tagged with a session id, and this
# keeps a per-session buffer:
#
#   * every chunk, the live (uncommitted) buffer is re-transcribed -> "partial" text, redrawn in grey
#   * when the buffer ends in enough silence, that segment is committed -> "committed" text, black
#   * committing clears the buffer, so cost stays bounded by segment length, not dictation length
#
# Plain HTTP rather than a websocket, deliberately: it reuses the existing owner-gated proxy in the
# sidecar and works on iOS Safari, which is the platform that forced server-side speech in the first
# place. On loopback, a POST per 500ms costs nothing measurable.
#
# Three things here exist because they were measured, not assumed. See the notes on each: the vocab
# prompt is gone, the temperature fallback is gone, and near-silent buffers are never decoded at all.

# and "Klipper, Zoraxy, is still routing the wiki subdomain". Measured over 38 buffers of silence,
# mid-word truncations and trailing-off speech: prompt on = 1 leak + 1 repetition loop + 0.62s mean
# decode; prompt off = 0 leaks, 0 repetition loops, 0.33s mean. `hotwords=` is the same mechanism
# under a different name and leaked identically, so it is not a fix either.
# The names are still corrected — by the Haiku cleanup pass, which has the same list and, unlike the
# decoder, can tell a name from a transcript. vocab.txt is left in place as the source of that list.
